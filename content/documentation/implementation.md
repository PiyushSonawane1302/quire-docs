## Affiliated Costs

Quire is free to use, however, there are occasionally associated costs:

- In order to output your Quire publication as a PDF you will need to use Prince XML. [Learn more about Prince's pricing plan.](https://www.princexml.com/purchase/).

- If you are at a small institution, you may want to hire a developer. [See our developer recommendations](#).

## Licensing

Beta access enables users to create anything they like with Quire and do anything with that creation that they’d like. You can modify your copy of the starter theme in any way that suits your needs. However, we ask that users **don’t redistribute Quire itself.**
