## Technology Requirements

- Quire is compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux

- It is recommended to have X amount of disk space available for installing Quire.

## Skill Requirements

- Quire can be used "out of the box" by any individual, no matter their skill level. However, in order to customize the Quire starter theme, advanced knowledge of CSS, HTML, and static-site generation, is required.

- We do provide additional [Resources](/learn/other-resources/) and [Tutorials](/learn/tutorial/) to aid non-technical users in gaining the skills and knowledge to use Quire in a more advanced way.

## Affiliated Costs

Quire is free to use, however, there are occasionally associated costs:

- In order to output your Quire publication as a PDF you will need to use Prince XML. [Learn more about Prince's pricing plan.](https://www.princexml.com/purchase/).

- If you are at a small institution, you may want to hire a developer. [See our developer recommendations](#).

## Licensing

Beta access enables users to create publications with Quire and distribute as they see fit. Users can modify the starter theme in any way that suits their needs. However, we ask that users **donâ€™t redistribute Quire itself.**
