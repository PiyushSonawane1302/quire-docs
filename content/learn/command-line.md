The {{< q-def "command-line shell" >}} is a text-based way of looking at your computer’s file contents. On Mac computers you’ll most often use a shell called Terminal.

This can be found by pressing Command-Spacebar to launch Spotlight.

Type "Terminal" and then double-click the search result.

Now, open your {{< q-def "home directory">}} (open Finder and press Command-Shift-H)

Go back to your Terminal and type `ls` (for list). You should now see names of files that match the contents of your home directory.

Terminal is also used as a tool for running program commands, and, for our purposes, can be used to tell Quire what to do. For example the command `quire new` can be used to start a new project and `quire pdf` can be used to generate the PDF version of your site. Learn more about how to start and preview projects, output files, and more in the [*Quire CLI Commands*](/documentaton/quire-cli/) section of our documentation.

Now that you are familiar with command-line you can use it to [install Quire](/documentation/install-uninstall/) on your computer.
