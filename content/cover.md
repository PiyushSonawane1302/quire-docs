Created by [the Getty](https://www.getty.edu/publications), Quire is a modern, multiformat publishing framework designed to create books as authoritative and enduring as print, and as vibrant and feature-rich as the web, from a single set of plain text files. All without ever signing-up for an account, paying a fee, or setting up and maintaining a complicated server.

Quire books are scholarly, visual, and built for discoverability and longevity. They feature:

- Page-level citation
- Footnotes
- Bibliographies
- Figure images and image groups
- Zooming images and maps
- Video and audio embeds
- Dynamic tables of contents and menus
- Full-text search
- Responsive web design
- Web accessibility and SEO optimized
- Outputs to web, PDF, and EPUB formats
