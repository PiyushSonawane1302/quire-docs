Created by [Getty](https://www.getty.edu/), Quire is a modern, multiformat publishing tool designed to create books as authoritative and enduring as print, and as vibrant and feature-rich as the web, from a single set of plain text files. All without paying a fee or setting up and maintaining a complicated server.

Quire books are scholarly, visual, and built for discoverability and longevity. They feature:

- Page-level citation
- Footnotes
- Bibliographies
- Figure images and image groups
- Zooming images and maps
- Video and audio embeds
- Dynamic tables of contents and menus
- Full-text search
- Responsive web design
- Web accessibility and SEO optimized
- Outputs to web, PDF, and EPUB formats

See these features in action in [the demo site](https://thegetty.github.io/quire-starter/), and in [Getty books](https://www.getty.edu/publications/digital/digitalpubs.html) developed with Quire.
