The Quire team at Getty continues work on Quire as a whole, including making improvements to the installation process, the overall architecture, and ongoing enhancements for web accessibility.

We also have planned a number of specific features being developed in conjunction with forthcoming Getty Publications’ books, which will also be built into Quire and released to the community.

## Quire Features in Development

<div class="feature-list">

- **IIIF Image Tiling**

    Adds deep-zooming to any image, using the open [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) specification. Either point Quire to an existing IIIF repository, or add high-resolutions images into a Quire project directly.

    *Expected release: Fall 2020*

- **Multi-level Subsections**

    Enables Quire publications to be authored with an arbitrary depth of content subsections that are supported by the table of contents and content navigation.

    *Expected release: Fall 2020*  

- **360º Images**

    Implements 360° rotating images as a standard feature for Quire publications.

- **Deep Linking**

    Implements functionality for deep linking to IIIF image regions and image annotation layers within a Quire publication.

- **Accordion Sections**

    Allows sections of primary content to be collapsed/expanded by a reader. Accordion sections are defined by an author using Quire markup short-codes and templates.

- **Catalogue Filters**

    Adds a set of HTML user interface elements to online Quire publications that allow a reader to update the objects displayed, showing only those that match the selected filter criteria. Catalogue filters will be based on the object meta-data fields defined in the objects.yml and the display of filters will be configurable by authors.
