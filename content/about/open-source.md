Open source is a way of developing software where the source code is free and available for others to use and adapt. Open-source software relies on both transparency and an engaged community of users. The community works together to both use and contribute to the development of the software and its code.

For the past four years, Getty has been using Quire to advance its internal publishing needs. This work has enabled us to test and refine the software. By open sourcing Quire and supporting its ongoing use in the field, other institutions can leverage Getty's work to help others publish online at low cost and with minimal ongoing maintenance.

Through the Quire beta program, new users are welcomed and encouraged to not only use Quire to create beautiful publications, but also to contribute meaningfully to Quire's growth and health as a publishing tool. Beta users have full access to Quire to create and customize any projects they’d like, and distribute those projects in any way they’d like. (We only request that users don’t redistribute Quire itself.) They also have access to staff at Getty and, equally importantly, to other Quire beta users; users who are similarly working to grow their own digital publishing projects and practices while helping us to improve Quire for others.

As Quire continues to evolve, our goal is to launch as fully open source by 2022 and expand Quire’s reach beyond our dedicated group of beta users. A community-supported model would enable Quire to remain free to use and would ensure a long lifespan beyond Getty.
