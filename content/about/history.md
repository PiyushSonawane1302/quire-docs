For over sixty years, [Getty](https://www.getty.edu/) has preserved the world's artistic legacy through the publication of award-winning books and journals. Over the last two decades, the internet has become a vital platform for the creation and dissemination of critical scholarship online. Yet the field of digital publishing still lacks reliable, affordable, and sustainable tools for presenting visually rich narratives that are globally accessible across devices and borders. Getty is uniquely positioned to build on its expertise in the field and advance this effort. Keep reading to learn how Quire evolved as the cornerstone of the institution's pioneering [digital publishing initiative](https://www.getty.edu/publications/digital/index.html).

**2009**

Getty Foundation launches the [Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI)](http://www.oscitoolkit.org/), a partnership between eight museums, exploring digital solutions to the high costs, limited access, and challenges of producing and updating scholarly publications.

**2013**

[Getty Publications](https://www.getty.edu/publications) begins investing in full-time digital publishing staff.

**2016**

Getty publishes its first digital catalogue, [*Ancient Terracottas*](https://www.getty.edu/publications/terracottas/). The publication,  built with OSCI, serves as a precursor to future Quire titles.

Also released this year are [*Roman Mosaics*](https://www.getty.edu/publications/romanmosaics/) and [*Introduction to Metadata, Third Edition*](https://www.getty.edu/publications/intrometadata/). [ARLIS/NA's *Multimedia & Technology Reviews*](https://arlisna.org/publications/multimedia-technology-reviews/1025-roman-mosaics-in-the-j-paul-getty-museum) writes that *Roman Mosaics* has a "dynamic design that encourages further discovery and scholarship."

Getty Publications editor, Ruth Evans Lane, writes an article for Getty's blog, The Iris. [*An Editor's View of Digital Publishing*](http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/an-editors-view-of-digital-publishing/) detailing her experience working on *Ancient Terracottas* and *Roman Mosaics*.

OSCI concludes. While the program transformed the digital publishing landscape for museums notable challenges remained, particularly around the discoverability, longevity, and objectness of digital catalogues. Read the [OSCI Final Report](https://www.getty.edu/publications/osci-report/remaining-challenges/) to learn more about the participants' conclusions.

Greg Albers and, former Getty developer, Eric Gardner, begin work on an early version of Quire with the goal of creating a tool that is not only beautiful and booklike, but also affordable, flexible, accessible, discoverable, and enduring.

Getty uses early Quire prototype to develop two digital publications [*Artistry in Bronze*](https://www.getty.edu/publications/artistryinbronze/index.html) and [*Ancient Lamps*.](https://www.getty.edu/publications/ancientlamps/)
