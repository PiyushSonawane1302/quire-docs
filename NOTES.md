NOTES FOR ERIN

- Added the Glossary page to the end of the Documentation section
- Chnages q-glossary to q-def to be consistent with other Quire projects with pop-up definitions
- I think it's better to make the years in the History timeline be H2 headings (both visually and semantically), but now they show up as links in the sidebar nav. What do you think?
- I don't like the faceless people image on the bottom of History, and maybe used elsewhere
- Should we use Sign Up instead of Request Access?
- ebook vs. e-book
- Should we make ourselves more present and more reachable? That personal service is what we're trying to move away from, but it's also What's led to success thus far.
- Took out the link to developers in Implementation consideration. We can add it back in when we have something to link to.

- Would like to get rid of the Helpful Tools page. And would suggest we have a Videos & Articles page. Also suggest moving Learn back up above documentation, it feels lost here.


- Rename Quire CLI to Quire?

I see you√Üre starting a new Quire project. Would you like to starte with a blank project, a demo project, or copy an existing project?

Would you like the classic or modern version of the theme?

Ok. What color would you like to be the accent color?

How about the background color.
