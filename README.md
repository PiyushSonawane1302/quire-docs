Quire is a modern, multiformat publishing framework designed to create books as authoritative and enduring as print, and as vibrant and feature-rich as the web, from a single set of plain text files. All without ever signing-up for an account, paying a fee, or setting up and maintaining a complicated server.

Quire books are scholarly, visual, and built for discoverability and longevity. They feature:

- Page-level citation
- Footnotes
- Bibliographies
- Figure images and image groups
- Zooming images and maps
- Video and audio embeds
- Dynamic tables of contents and menus
- Full-text search
- Responsive web design
- Web accessibility and SEO optimized
- Outputs to web, PDF, and EPUB formats

Check out [the demo site](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire-starter/), and [some of the Getty’s books developed with early versions of Quire.](https://www.getty.edu/publications/digital/digitalpubs.html)

Quire is centered around [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), and uses [PrinceXML](http://www.princexml.com/) for PDF generation and [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) for EPUBs. It consists of four primary repositories, all of which but this one are closed during development.
