# Quire Documentation Contributor Guidelines

**Thank you for your interest in contributing to Quire!**

Developed by Getty, Quire is a new, multiformat publishing tool available for immediate access and use. Quire is in a limited beta, ¬© J. Paul Getty Trust, and not yet released as open-source software. **For a free license to use Quire, please complete [this form](http://bit.ly/quire-signup).**

Striving toward becoming a fully open-source project by spring 2022, we encourage contributions from our community members. No matter what level of experience you have, we welcome all contributions, big and small. 

There are two main code repositories for Quire hosted on GitHub.

- [**quire**](https://github.com/thegetty/quire): The command-line interface for Quire, default starter content, and default theme.
- [**quire-docs**](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs): The Quire website and documentation.

You are currently in the **quire-docs** repository. The Quire website and documentation are continuously being updated for clarity and completeness, but it‚Äôs not always easy to keep up with the pace of Quire‚Äôs development! There are [several ways to contribute](#identify-a-contribution-to-make) to the Quire website and documentation including:

- Correct one-off typos
- Fix broken links 
- Copyedit text
- Propose/write a new section
- Propose/write an article for the website
- Translate our documentation

Before getting started, please read both our [Quire Documentation Style Guide](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/wiki/Quire-Website-&-Documentation-Style-Guide) and the following contributing guidelines. Our goal is to make the process as effective and transparent as possible, and to ensure that your every contribution can become part of Quire. Thank you for taking the time.

üó£**CALLING ALL FIRST-TIMERS!** ‚Äî We can‚Äôt stress enough that Quire is open to contributors at all levels. Here are a few resources especially for you:

**All are welcome.** As an open-source community, Quire is committed to providing a safe, welcoming, transparent, and inclusive environment for all our community members and those wishing to become involved.

## Identify a Contribution to Make

The first step to any contribution is to post a new issue or comment on an existing issue [on our issue tracker](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues/). This helps avoid changes being rejected before you've done too much work. Be sure to briefly describe your proposed solution and say whether you may need help with any aspect of it. This approach has several advantages:

- Lets people know you‚Äôre working on it
- Gives the core team and the community a chance to give feedback before you do any work
- Helps to ensure your contribution will be accepted and successfully merged in

Below is a list of possible contribution types. 

### Fix a Typo or Broken Link

Sometimes little things like typos or broken links can slip through the cracks. That's where we could use your help. These types of small edits make for good first issues.  

[Identify a typo or broken link](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/issues/new)

### Copyedit Text 

If you see a section of the text that can be improved or clarified, please flag it for us and feel free to jump in and make the changes you see fit. 

[Share your copyediting idea](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/issues/new)

### Propose/Write a New Section

If you've recently contributed a new feature to our main [Quire repository](https://github.com/thegetty/quire) and have the time to add the appropriate documentation please do so. 

If you come across a TK section and would like to complete it, let us know. 

Finally, if you have an idea for a section that needs to be added to help extend Quire's usability, let us know or write it yourself. 

[Share your new section idea](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/issues/new)

### Propose/Write an Article for the Website 

We‚Äôre always interested in adding articles about specific aspects of working in Quire to our Learn knowledge base. Maybe you have some tips on modifying shortcodes or styling is CSS in the custom.css. Chances are the community would love to read about it.

[Share your article idea](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/issues/new)

*And if you need help getting your article converted from it‚Äôs current format into Markdown and onto the Quire website, we‚Äôre happy to guide you through that process.*

### Translate the Documentation

The Quire community is global and we hope to be able to continue to expand access to Quire, including to non-English speakers. Though we haven‚Äôt yet done any translation work on any of the documentation or materials, if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre interested in doing, we‚Äôd love to talk to you.

[Volunteer to do some translation](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues)

## Start Work on Contribution

Now that you've identified the contribution you'd like to make and posted about it on our [issues board](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/issues), you're ready to get to work actually working in Quire. Please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository by following [these instructions](https://quire.getty.edu/documentation/github/#installing-an-existing-quire-project-from-github).
- We recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to clone your repository and manage any changes. Refer to [GitHub Desktop documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) for further details.
- Be sure to run `quire install` before proceeding.

2. [Create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-branches) and make your changes.
- Please review our [Documentation Style Guide](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/wiki/Quire-Website-&-Documentation-Style-Guide) and ensure you are contributing in the style of the project to the best of your abiltiies.
- Test your changes by running `quire preview`.

## Submit Your Contribution

*We manage Quire through GitHub. If you are new to GitHub, we recommend starting with [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github) to learn by topic, and for a broad overview, [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/). We also encourage you to check out Coding Train‚Äôs fantastic video series [Git and Github for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV). GitHub can be accessed through the command line or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).*

Once you've identified your contribution and started work on your contribution, you will prepare to submit it to us for review as a pull request. A pull request says, ‚ÄúHey, I did something useful for you, want to pull it in and merge it into your project?‚Äù

A pull request is a chance for Quire‚Äôs core team to evaluate the proposed changes made and decide whether to:

- merge them in as is
- merge them in with changes
- reject them

A pull request doesn‚Äôt have to represent finished work. **We always recommend opening a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù (Work in Progress) in the subject line.** As you make new commits to that branch and push them to GitHub, they‚Äôll automatically be added to the open pull request.

This is something like what the development process may look like for you:

1. Submit a pull request through GitHub.
  - If this is your first time putting in a pull request on a project like this, we recommend the [*First Contributions* command line](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions), or [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/gui-tool-tutorials/github-desktop-tutorial.md) tutorial. Or, Kent C. Dodds' video series, [‚ÄúHow to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub‚Äù](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
  - Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your pull request description (for example, ‚ÄúCloses #203.‚Äù)
  - Explain what the changes do, and what your approach was. If there were alternate ways of doing it, mention them and tell us why you didn‚Äôt choose them.
  - If this is a Work in Progress pull request, comment on where you are and what your next steps are.
  - Include screenshots of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request as needed.
2. Respond as needed to the review of your work by Quire‚Äôs core team.
  - Answer questions in the pull request comments.
  - Make changes and new commits if needed, or suggest alternate solutions if you have them.
3. See your work merged in to Quire! üéâ

**At this point, we hope you feel ready to contribute! But don‚Äôt hesitate to [ask for help or clarification](mailto:quire@getty.edu), everyone‚Äôs a beginner at first. And thank you again for your interest in making Quire a better tool for all!** ü¶Ñ
