# Quire Documentation Contributor Guidelines

>**All are welcome.** As an open-source community, Quire is committed to providing a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment for all our community members and those wishing to become involved. Please see our **[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** for more on the expectations and protections we have in place for the community.

**Thank you for your interest in contributing to Quire!** 

We recommend following the process outlined below to ensure a smooth contributing experience. Our goal is to make the process as effective and transparent as possible and ensure that your every contribution can become part of Quire.

## About Contributing to Quire

Developed by Getty, Quire is a new, multiformat publishing tool available for immediate access and use. Quire is in limited beta, ¬© J. Paul Getty Trust, and not yet released as open-source software. **For a free license to use Quire, please complete [this form](http://bit.ly/quire-signup).**

Striving toward becoming a fully open-source project by spring 2022, we encourage contributions from our community members. No matter what level of experience you have, we welcome all contributions, big and small.

There are two Quire repositories hosted on GitHub that you can contribute to:

- [**quire**](https://github.com/thegetty/quire):  Core Quire code including command-line interface, default starter content, and default theme.
- [**quire-docs**](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs): Quire website and documentation.

You are currently in the **quire-docs** repository. The Quire website and documentation are actually built using Quire. That means contributing to this repo will give you an opportunity to work on a live Quire project. The process may be familiar for some, and for others, it will be a good way to familiarize yourself with the tool. If you haven't already, please [install Quire](https://quire.getty.edu/documentation/install-uninstall/) to get started. 

>üó£**CALLING ALL FIRST-TIMERS!** ‚Äî We can‚Äôt stress enough that Quire is open to contributors at all levels. Here are a few resources especially for you:
>- Find [‚Äúgood first issues‚Äù](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues) tagged in our issue tracker for the thegetty/quire-docs repo
>- Read the Quire guide to Making Your First Contribution ‚Äî *in progress*
>- Learn more about contributing to open source at [First Timers Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

## Identify a Contribution to Make

Our website and docs are updated continuously for clarity and completeness, but it‚Äôs not always easy to keep up with the pace of Quire‚Äôs development. We invite you to share your ideas or jump in and make edits yourself. There are several ways to contribute to the Quire website and documentation.

**Fix a Typo or Broken Link:** Sometimes, little things like typos or broken links can slip through the cracks, and every small fix you make really helps.

**Copyedit Text:** As a regular user of Quire, you‚Äôll likely find sections of the text that can be improved or clarified for other users. You‚Äôll know best!

**Propose/Write a New Section:** Have you recently contributed a new feature to our main [Quire repository](https://github.com/thegetty/quire) and have the time to add the corresponding documentation? Have you come across a TK section (shorthand for ‚Äúto come‚Äù) and would like to complete it? Do you have an idea for a new section? We‚Äôd love your help!

**Propose/Write an Article for the Website:** We‚Äôre always interested in adding articles about specific aspects of working in Quire to our [Learn](https://quire.getty.edu/learn/) knowledge base. Maybe you have some tips on modifying shortcodes or styling with CSS in the custom.css.

**Translate the Documentation:** The Quire community is global, and we hope to be able to continue to expand access to Quire, including non-English speakers. If you are interested in translating our documentation or even just sections of the documentation, we'd love to talk to you about it.

### Use the Issue Tracker

We use GitHub‚Äôs [issue tracker](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues/) to track work that needs to be done, is currently being done, or is proposed to be done. 

You can use it to find an existing issue to work on, post about a new issue that you‚Äôd propose working on, or post about a new issue you‚Äôve found that someone else might work on.

#### Work on an Existing Issue

If you are working on a previously posted issue, please comment on that issue and let us know you are working on it. That prevents duplicating efforts or having your changes rejected because someone else is working on it.

#### Post a New Issue

If your changes are small or straightforward, then there is no need to create a new issue. Just dive in and get to work. However, if you are proposing or attempting a large/complex change, please post a new issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues/) before proceeding. This helps avoid changes being rejected before you've done too much work. Be sure to briefly describe your proposed solution and say whether you may need help with any aspect of it. This approach has several advantages:

- Lets people know you‚Äôre working on it
- Gives the core team and the community a chance to give feedback before you do any work
- Helps to ensure your contribution will be accepted and successfully merged in

## Start Work on Contribution

Now that you've identified your contribution, your next step will be to use GitHub and a text editor (such as Atom) to make the desired changes.

>We use GitHub to manage all our work on Quire. If you are new to GitHub, we recommend creating a [new GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and downloading [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Before getting started, review the [GitHub Desktop documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) and the [Project Management with GitHub](https://quire.getty.edu/documentation/github/) section of the Quire documentation. An abbreviated explanation of how to submit changes via GitHub is included below.

**Download Your Quire Project from Github**
1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Click on the upper left-hand corner of the application window, where it says ‚ÄúCurrent Repository.‚Äù Click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù and choose the option to ‚ÄúClone repository‚Ä¶‚Äù. (If this is your first time using GitHub Desktop, you will see a button to "Clone a Repository from the Internet" instead.
3. Click the URL menu option and cut-and-paste the following URL: https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs, and click the "Clone" button. (Be sure to adjust the local path, so the `quire-docs` repo is saved in your `home directory`.)

**Preview Your Quire Publication**
1. Pull up your [command line](https://quire.getty.edu/learn/tutorial/#1-work-in-a-command-line-shell) to navigate through your computer files.
2. Use the `cd` command to navigate to your computer's home directory and then navigate into your `quire-docs` folder.
3. Once you are in your `quire-docs` folder, run the following commands:
```
quire install
```
and then 
```
quire preview
```
4. Go to [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) to preview the project as you work on it.

**Create a New Branch in GitHub Desktop**
1. In GitHub desktop, make sure you are in the correct repository. At the top right, under "Current Repository," it should say `quire-docs`. If not, click the down arrow and choose the docs repo from the menu. 
2. Navigate to where it says ‚ÄúCurrent Branch‚Äù at the top of your GitHub Desktop window.
3. Click the drop-down arrow and select ‚Äúnew branch‚Äù to the right of the Filter box.
4. Name your branch following this branch naming convention: `docs/action-section being edited_github name`. (For example: `docs/edit-deploy_quire-user`)
5. Make sure it is based on the `main` branch. 

**Fork Repository**
1. Once your branch has been created, click the "Publish branch" button at the right of your screen.
2. A message will pop up asking if you'd like to "fork this repository." Forking a repository means you are making a copy of it. This will allow you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. In other words, it is a safe and protected way of working. Click "Fork This Repository." 
3. You will be asked how you plan to use this fork. Choose "To contribute to the parent project" and click "Continue." 
4. Click "Publish Branch" again. Now you are ready to get to work!

**Open Project File in Text Editor**
1. Open the text editor of your choice. (We suggest using [Atom](atom.io).) 
2. Select File > Open in your menu bar.
3. Navigate to your home directory and select your `quire-docs` folder.
4. In your text editor, expand the `content` folder to see the editable markdown files and look for the file you'd like to make your changes in.

**Save Changes in Text Editor**
1. To save changes, hit File > Save or Command-S (Mac) or Control-S (PC).
2. If working on multiple markdown files, make sure to save each file individually. 
3. Double-check that your changes look right by previewing at [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).

**Make Commits in GitHub Desktop**
1. At the bottom left, above where it says description, write a short and meaningful name for your commit. You have the option to include a description as well.
2. Press the blue button that says, ‚ÄúCommit to [branch name].‚Äù

**Push Changes in GitHub**
1. You will be given the option to "Push origin." Click this button. 
2. Now the changes you've made have been successfully saved to your branch on GitHub.

## Submit Your Contribution

Once you've identified your contribution and pushed those changes through GitHub Desktop, you will submit it to us for review as a pull request. A pull request says, ‚ÄúHey, I did something useful for you, want to pull it in and merge it into your project?‚Äù

A pull request is a chance for Quire‚Äôs core team to evaluate the proposed changes made and decide whether to:

- merge them in as-is
- merge them in with changes
- reject them

>A pull request doesn‚Äôt have to represent finished work. We always recommend opening a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Please mark a "work in progress" pull request as a draft by following [these instructions](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) when submitting. As you make new commits to that branch and push them to GitHub, they‚Äôll automatically be added to the open pull request.

**Create a Pull Request in GitHub**
1. Click the blue button that says ‚ÄúCreate Pull Request.‚Äù This will take you to GitHub.com.
2. Confirm that the branch in the base repository drop-down menu is the `main` branch of the `thegetty/quire-docs` repo. The head repository will be `GitHub-username/quire-docs`. (For example, `quire-user/quire docs`.) The compare branch should be the one you just created.  
3. You can leave the default title or type a new title and description.
4. Click the green button that says ‚ÄúCreate Pull Request‚Äù if all your changes are ready for review. Or click the drop-down arrow and choose ‚ÄúCreate Draft Pull Request‚Äù if you are still making changes.
5. Once your pull request has been reviewed and approved, you will see your work merged into the Quire documentation and website!!

Here are a few tips when submitting your pull request:
- If this is your first time putting in a pull request on a project like this, we recommend the [*First Contributions* command line](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) or Kent C. Dodds' video series, [‚ÄúHow to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub.‚Äù](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
- Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your pull request description (for example, ‚ÄúCloses #203.‚Äù)
- Follow the pull request template to explain what changes were made and what your goal is.
- Include screenshots of the before and after, if relevant.
- You may receive feedback or requests for changes to your pull request from the Quire team before your work can be merged. Answer questions in the pull request comments, make changes and new commits if needed, or suggest alternative solutions if you have them.

Thank you for reading our `quire-docs` Contributing Guidelines. To learn more about contributing to open-source projects, check out the *Open Source Guide*‚Äôs [‚ÄúHow to Contribute to Open Source.‚Äù](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

**At this point, we hope you feel ready to contribute! But don‚Äôt hesitate to [ask for help or clarification](mailto:quire@getty.edu); everyone‚Äôs a beginner at first. And thank you again for your interest in making Quire a better tool for all!** ü¶Ñ
