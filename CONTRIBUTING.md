Please see our **[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** for more on the expectations and protections for our community members.

**Thank you for your interest in contributing to Quire!** Here is the process we would like you to follow.

## About Contributing to Quire

Developed by Getty, Quire is a new, multiformat publishing tool available for immediate access and use. Quire is in a limited beta, ¬© J. Paul Getty Trust, and not yet released as open-source software. **For a free license to use Quire, please complete [this form](http://bit.ly/quire-signup).**

Striving toward becoming a fully open-source project by spring 2022, we encourage contributions from our community members. No matter what level of experience you have, we welcome all contributions, big and small. 

There are two Quire repositories hosted on GitHub that can contribute to:

- [**quire**](https://github.com/thegetty/quire):  Core Quire code including command-line interface, default starter content, and default theme.
- [**quire-docs**](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs): Quire website and documentation.

You are currently in the **quire-docs** repository. The Quire website and documentation are actually built using Quire, so if you haven't already, you will need to [install Quire](https://quire.getty.edu/documentation/install-uninstall/) before making any contributions. Our website and docs are updated continuously for clarity and completeness but it‚Äôs not always easy to keep up with the pace of Quire‚Äôs development. We invite you to share your ideas or jump in and make edits yourself. There are [several ways to contribute](#identify-a-contribution-to-make) to the Quire website and documentation including:

- Correct one-off typos
- Fix broken links 
- Copyedit text
- Propose/write a new section
- Propose/write an article for the website
- Translate our documentation

Before getting started, please read both our [Quire Website & Documentation Style Guide](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/wiki/Quire-Website-&-Documentation-Style-Guide) and the Contributing Guidelines as they follow below. Our goal is to make the process as effective and transparent as possible, and to ensure that your every contribution can become part of Quire. Thank you for taking the time. 

>üó£**CALLING ALL FIRST-TIMERS!** ‚Äî We can‚Äôt stress enough that Quire is open to contributors at all levels. Here are a few resources especially for you:
>- Find [‚Äúgood first issues‚Äù](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues) tagged in our issue tracker for the thegetty/quire-docs repo
>- Read the Quire guide to Making Your First Contribution ‚Äî *in progress*
>- Learn more about contributing to open source at [First Timers Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

## Identify a Contribution to Make

There are several ways to identify a contribution:

1. **Work on an existing issue**

If you are working on a previously posted issue, please comment on that issue and let us know you are working on it. That prevents duplicating efforts or having your changes rejected because someone else is working on it. 

2. **Post a new issue** 

If your changes are small or straightforward then there is no need to create a new issue. Just dive in and get to work. However, if you are proposing or attempting a large/complex change please post a new issue [on our issue tracker](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues/) before proceeding. This helps avoid changes being rejected before you've done too much work. Be sure to briefly describe your proposed solution and say whether you may need help with any aspect of it. This approach has several advantages:

- Lets people know you‚Äôre working on it
- Gives the core team and the community a chance to give feedback before you do any work
- Helps to ensure your contribution will be accepted and successfully merged in

Below is a list of possible contribution types. 

### Fix a Typo or Broken Link

Sometimes little things like typos or broken links can slip through the cracks. That's where we could use your help. Please feel free to dive right in and make your changes. If you don't feel like working on these yourself, please add them to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues/) as small edits make for good first issues.  

### Copyedit Text 

If you see a section of the text that can be improved or clarified, please either jump in and make corrections or add it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues/) for someone else to work on. 

### Propose/Write a New Section

If you've recently contributed a new feature to our main [Quire repository](https://github.com/thegetty/quire) and have the time to add the corresponding documentation, please do so. Or add it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues/) to let us know we need to write it.

If you come across a TK section and would like to complete it, please let us know you are working on it by posting on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues/).  

Finally, if you have an idea for a new section, add it to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues/) before getting started or suggesting it for someone else to work on.

### Propose/Write an Article for the Website 

We‚Äôre always interested in adding articles about specific aspects of working in Quire to our Learn knowledge base. Maybe you have some tips on modifying shortcodes or styling is CSS in the custom.css. Please add it to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues/) to let us know you are working on it. Chances are the community would love to read about it. 

### Translate the Documentation

The Quire community is global and we hope to be able to continue to expand access to Quire, including to non-English speakers. If you are interested in translating our documentation or even just sections of the documentation please let us know in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues/). We'd love to talk to you about it.

## Start Work on Contribution

Now that you've identified your contribution, your next step will be to use GitHub and Atom to make the desired changes. 

>We use GitHub to manage all our work on Quire. If you are new to GitHub, we recommend downloading [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Before getting started, review the [GitHub Desktop documenation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) and the [Project Management with GitHub] section of the Quire documentation. An abbreviated explantion of how to submit changes via GitHub included below.

**Download Your Quire Project from Github**
1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Click on the upper left-hand corner of the application window, where it says ‚ÄúCurrent Repository‚Äù. Click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù and choose the option to ‚ÄúClone repository‚Ä¶‚Äù
3. Click the URL menu option and cut-and-paste the following URL: https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs. 
4. Save the cloned `quire-docs` repo in your home directory.

**Preview Your Quire Publication**
1. Next, pull up your [command line](https://quire.getty.edu/learn/tutorial/#1-work-in-a-command-line-shell) to navigate through your computer files.
2. Use the cd command to navigate to your computer's home directory and then navigate into your `quire-docs` folder. 
3. Once you are in your `quire-docs` folder, run the following commands:
```
quire install
quire preview
```
4. Go to [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) the project as you work on it.

**Open Your Project in GitHub Desktop**
1. At the top right, click "Current Repository" and choose the `quire-docs` repo. 

**Create a New Branch in GitHub Desktop**
1. Navigate to where it says ‚ÄúCurrent Branch‚Äù at the top of your GitHub Desktop window.
2. Click the drop-down arrow and select ‚Äúnew branch‚Äù to the right of the Filter box.
3. Name your branch.
4. Select ‚Äúmain‚Äù where it says ‚ÄúCreate branch based on.‚Äù This means you are creating a new branch that runs parallel to the main project.

**Open Project File in Atom**
1. Open Atom
2. Click File > Open
3. Navigate to your home directory and your select `quire-docs` folder.
5. In Atom, expand the contents folder to see the editable markdown files and look for the file you'd like to make your changes in.

**Save Changes in Atom**
1. To save changes, hit File > Save or Command-S (Mac) or Control-S (PC).
2. If working on multiple markdown files, make sure to save each file individually. You will see a little blue dot at the top of the page if there are any unsaved changes.
3. Double check that your changes look right by previewing at [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).

**Make Commits in GitHub Desktop**
1. At the bottom left, above where it says description, write a short name for your commit. You have the option to include a description as well.
2. Press the blue button that says ‚ÄúCommit to [branch name].‚Äù

**Push Changes in GitHub**
1. After you have made all your commits, click on the "Publish Branch" and then ‚ÄúPush Origin‚Äù button at the top right.
2. Now the changes to your project have been successfully saved to your branch on GitHub.

## Submit Your Contribution

Once you've identified your contribution and submitted changes through GitHub Desktop, you will prepare to submit it to us for review as a pull request. A pull request says, ‚ÄúHey, I did something useful for you, want to pull it in and merge it into your project?‚Äù

A pull request is a chance for Quire‚Äôs core team to evaluate the proposed changes made and decide whether to:

- merge them in as is
- merge them in with changes
- reject them

>A pull request doesn‚Äôt have to represent finished work. We always recommend opening a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. When submitting a work in progress pull request, please mark it as a draft by following [these instructions](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/). As you make new commits to that branch and push them to GitHub, they‚Äôll automatically be added to the open pull request.

**Create a Pull Request in GitHub**
1. Click the blue-button that says ‚ÄúCreate Pull Request.‚Äù This will take you to GitHub.com.
2. Confirm that the branch in the base drop-down menu is the `main` branch of the `quire-docs` repo.
3. You can leave the default title or type a new title and description for your pull request.
4. On the right-hand side, you will see an option to choose a reviewer. Choose **@erin-cecele** and she will receive a notification of your pull request.
5. Click the green-button that says ‚ÄúCreate Pull Request‚Äù if all your changes are ready for review. Or click the drop-down arrow and choose ‚ÄúCreate Draft Pull Request‚Äù if you are still making changes that will be included in this particular pull request.
6. Once your pull request has been reviewed and approved, you will see your work merged into the Quire documentation and website!! 

Here are a few tips when submitting your pull request:
- If this is your first time putting in a pull request on a project like this, we recommend the [*First Contributions* command line](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions), or Kent C. Dodds' video series, [‚ÄúHow to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub‚Äù](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
- Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your pull request description (for example, ‚ÄúCloses #203.‚Äù)
- Follow the pull request remplate to explain what the changes do and what your approach was. 
- Include screenshots of the before and after if relevant.
- You may receive feedback or requests for changes to your pull request from Quire‚Äôs core team before your work can be merged. Answer questions in the pull request comments, make changes and new commits if needed, or suggest alternate solutions if you have them.

Thank your for reading our `quire-docs` Contributing Guidelines. To learn more in the *Open Source Guide*‚Äôs [‚ÄúHow to Contribute to Open Source‚Äù](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

**At this point, we hope you feel ready to contribute! But don‚Äôt hesitate to [ask for help or clarification](mailto:quire@getty.edu), everyone‚Äôs a beginner at first. And thank you again for your interest in making Quire a better tool for all!** ü¶Ñ
